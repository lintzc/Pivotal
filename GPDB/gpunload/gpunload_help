COMMAND NAME: gpunload

Runs an extract job as defined in a YAML formatted control file.


*****************************************************
SYNOPSIS
*****************************************************

With control file:
gpunload -f <control_file> [-l <log_file>] [-h <hostname>] [-p <port>]
[-U <username>] [-d <database>] [-W] [--gpfdist_timeout <seconds>] 
[[-v | -V] [-q]] [-D]

Without control file:
gpunload -t <source_table_name> [--output_dir <output_directory>] [-l <log_file>] [-h <hostname>] [-p <port>]
[-U <username>] [-d <database>] [-W] [--gpfdist_timeout <seconds>] 
[[-v | -V] [-q]] [-D]

gpunload -? 

gpunload --version


*****************************************************
PREREQUISITES
*****************************************************

The client machine where gpunload is executed must have the following: 

* Python 2.6.2 or later, pygresql (the Python interface to PostgreSQL), 
  and pyyaml. Note that Python and the required Python libraries are 
  included with the Greenplum Database server installation, so if you have 
  Greenplum Database installed on the machine where gpunload is running, 
  you do not need a separate Python installation. 

  Note: Greenplum Loaders for Windows supports only Python 2.5 
  (available from www.python.org). 

* The gpfdist parallel file distribution program installed and in your 
  $PATH. This program is located in $GPHOME/bin of your Greenplum Database 
  server installation. 

* Network access to and from all hosts in your Greenplum Database array 
 (master and segments). 

* Network access to and from the hosts where the data to be extracted 
  resides (ETL servers). 

  
*****************************************************
DESCRIPTION
*****************************************************

gpunload is a data extracting utility that acts as an interface to Greenplum 
Databases writable external table parallel extracting feature. Using a unload 
specification defined in a YAML formatted control file, gpunload executes 
an extract by invoking the Greenplum parallel file server (gpfdist), 
creating a writable external table definition based on the source data defined, 
and executing an INSERT operation into the external table to extract the source 
table into the target file. 

 
*****************************************************
OPTIONS
*****************************************************

-f <control_file> 

 Required if the option -t is not used. A YAML file that contains the unload specification details. See 
 following section "Control File Format".
 This option is not compatible with the option -t.

-t <source_table_name> 

 Required if the option -f is not used. This option prevents to use a YAML file
 and simply extracts the source table with no transformation into a csv file.
 This option is not compatible with the option -f.

--output_dir <output_directory> 

 Only used with the option -t. Defines the directory in which the extracted file
 will be written.
 If not set, the default output directory is /tmp/
 
--gpfdist_timeout <seconds> 

 Sets the timeout for the gpfdist parallel file distribution program to 
 send a response. Enter a value from 0 to 30 seconds (entering "0" to 
 disables timeouts). Note that you might need to increase this value when 
 operating on high-traffic networks. 

-l <log_file>

 Specifies where to write the log file. Defaults to 
 ~/gpAdminLogs/gpunload_YYYYMMDD. See Also: LOG FILE FORMAT section. 

 
-q (no screen output) 

 Run in quiet mode. Command output is not displayed on the screen, but is 
 still written to the log file. 

 
-D (debug mode) 

 Check for error conditions, but do not execute the unload. 

 
-v (verbose mode) 

 Show verbose output of the unload steps as they are executed. 


-V (very verbose mode) 

 Shows very verbose output. 

 
-? (show help) 

 Show help, then exit. 

 
--version 

Show the version of this utility, then exit. 

*********************
CONNECTION OPTIONS
*********************

-d <database> 

 The database to extract from. If not specified, reads from the unload control 
 file, the environment variable $PGDATABASE or defaults to the current 
 system user name. 


-h <hostname>

 Specifies the host name of the machine on which the Greenplum master 
 database server is running. If not specified, reads from the unload 
 control file, the environment variable $PGHOST or defaults to localhost. 


-p <port> 

 Specifies the TCP port on which the Greenplum master database server is 
 listening for connections. If not specified, reads from the unload control 
 file, the environment variable $PGPORT or defaults to 5432. 


-U <username> 

 The database role name to connect as. If not specified, reads from the 
 unload control file, the environment variable $PGUSER or defaults to the 
 current system user name. 


-W (force password prompt) 

 Force a password prompt. If not specified, reads the password from the 
 environment variable $PGPASSWORD or from a password file specified by 
 $PGPASSFILE or in ~/.pgpass. If these are not set, then gpunload will 
 prompt for a password even if -W is not supplied. 


*****************************************************
CONTROL FILE FORMAT
*****************************************************

The gpunload control file uses the YAML 1.1 document format and then 
implements its own schema for defining the various steps of a Greenplum 
Database unload operation. The control file must be a valid YAML document. 

The gpunload program processes the control file document in order and uses 
indentation (spaces) to determine the document hierarchy and the 
relationships of the sections to one another. The use of white space is 
significant. White space should not be used simply for formatting 
purposes, and tabs should not be used at all. 

The basic structure of an extract control file is: 

---
VERSION: 1.0.0.1
DATABASE: <db_name>
USER: <db_username>
HOST: <master_hostname>
PORT: <master_port>

*****************************************************
CONTROL FILE SCHEMA ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS
*****************************************************


VERSION - Optional. The version of the gpunload control file 
          schema. The current version is 1.0.0.1. 

DATABASE - Optional. Specifies which database in Greenplum to 
           connect to. If not specified, defaults to $PGDATABASE 
           if set or the current system user name. You can also 
           specify the database on the command line using the -d option. 

USER - Optional. Specifies which database role to use to connect. 
       If not specified, defaults to the current user or $PGUSER if set. 
       You can also specify the database role on the command line using 
       the -U option. 

       If the user running gpunload is not a Greenplum superuser, then the 
       server configuration parameter gp_external_grant_privileges must 
       be set to on in order for the load to be processed. See the
       "Greenplum Database Reference Guide" for more information.

HOST - Optional. Specifies Greenplum master host name. If not specified, 
       defaults to localhost or $PGHOST if set. You can also specify the 
       master host name on the command line using the -h option.

PORT - Optional. Specifies Greenplum master port. If not specified, defaults
       to 5432 or $PGPORT if set. You can also specify the master port on 
       the command line using the -p option.

GPUNLOAD - Required. Begins the load specification section. A GPUNLOAD specification
         must have an INPUT and an OUTPUT section defined.

OUTPUT - Required. Defines the location and the format of the output data to 
        be unloaded. gpunload will start one or more instances of the gpfdist file
        distribution program on the current host and create the required external
        table definition(s) in Greenplum Database that point to the source data. 
        Note that the host from which you run gpunload must be accessible over the 
        network by all Greenplum hosts (master and segments).

TARGET - Required. The TARGET block of an OUTPUT specification defines the 
         location of a target file. An OUTPUT section can have more than one 
         TARGET block defined. Each TARGET block defined corresponds to one 
         instance of the gpfdist file distribution program that will be started 
         on the local machine. Each TARGET block defined must have a FILE 
         specification.
         
         For more information about using the gpfdist parallel file server 
         and single and multiple gpfdist instances, see the "Greenplum Database 
         Database Administrator Guide."

LOCAL_HOSTNAME - Optional. Specifies the host name or IP address of the local 
       machine on which gpunload is running. If this machine is configured
       with multiple network interface cards (NICs), you can specify the 
       host name or IP of each individual NIC to allow network traffic 
       to use all NICs simultaneously. The default is to use the local 
       machines primary host name or IP only. 

PORT - Optional. Specifies the specific port number that the gpfdist file 
       distribution program should use. You can also supply a PORT_RANGE to 
       select an available port from the specified range. If both PORT and 
       PORT_RANGE are defined, then PORT takes precedence. If neither PORT or 
       PORT_RANGE are defined, the default is to select an available port between 
       8000 and 9000. 
       
       If multiple host names are declared in LOCAL_HOSTNAME, this port number
       is used for all hosts. This configuration is desired if you want to use 
       all NICs to load the same file or set of files in a given directory location.

PORT_RANGE - Optional. Can be used instead of PORT to supply a range of port 
       numbers from which gpunload can choose an available port for this 
       instance of the gpfdist file distribution program.

FILE - Required. Specifies the location of a file, named pipe, or directory 
       location on the local file system where the data are extracted. You can
       declare more than one file so long as the data is of the same format in 
       all files specified.
       specified.

SSL - Optional. Specifies usage of SSL encryption. If SSL is set to true, gpunload 
       starts the gpfdist server with the --ssl option and uses the gpfdists 
       protocol.

CERTIFICATES_PATH - Required when SSL is true; cannot be specified when SSL is 
       false or unspecified. The location specified in 
       CERTIFICATES_PATH must contain the following files:
            * The server certificate file, server.crt
            * The server private key file, server.key
            * The trusted certificate authorities, root.crt

       The root directory (/) cannot be specified as CERTIFICATES_PATH.

COLUMNS - Optional. Specifies the schema of the target data file(s) in the 
          format of  <field_name>: <data_type>. The DELIMITER character 
          in the target file is what separates two data value fields (columns). 
          A row is determined by a line feed character (0x0a).
          
          If the output COLUMNS are not specified, then the schema of the input
          TABLE is implied, meaning that the target file must have the same 
          column order, number of columns, and data format as the source table.
          
          The default source-to-target mapping is based on a match of column names
          as defined in this section and the column names in the target TABLE. 
          This default mapping can be overridden using the MAPPING section.

MAX_LINE_LENGTH - Optional. An integer that specifies the maximum length of 
                  a line passed to gpfdist.

FORMAT - Optional. Specifies the format of the target data file(s) - either plain
         text (TEXT) or comma separated values (CSV) format. Defaults to TEXT 
         if not specified. For more information about the format of the target
         data, see the "Greenplum Database Database Administrator Guide."

DELIMITER - Optional. Specifies a single ASCII character that separates columns
            within each row (line) of data. The default is a tab character in TEXT
            mode, a comma in CSV mode. You can also specify a non-printable ASCII
            character or a non-printable unicode character, for example: "\x1B" or
            "\u001B". The escape string syntax, E'<character-code>', is also
            supported for non-printable characters. The ASCII or unicode character
            must be enclosed in single quotes. For example: E'\x1B' or E'\u001B'. 

ESCAPE - Optional. Specifies the single character that is used for C escape sequences
        (such as \n,\t,\100, and so on) and for escaping data characters 
        that might otherwise be taken as row or column delimiters. Make sure 
        to choose an escape character that is not used anywhere in your actual
        column data. The default escape character is a \ (backslash) for 
        text-formatted files and a " (double quote) for csv-formatted files, 
        however it is possible to specify another character to represent an 
        escape. It is also possible to disable escaping in text-formatted 
        files by specifying the value 'OFF' as the escape value. This is very
        useful for data such as text-formatted web log data that has many 
        embedded backslashes that are not intended to be escapes. 

NULL_AS - Optional. Specifies the string that represents a null value. 
          The default is \N (backslash-N) in TEXT mode, and an empty value 
          with no quotations in CSV mode. You might prefer an empty string 
          even in TEXT mode for cases where you do not want to distinguish 
          nulls from empty strings. Any source data item that matches this 
          string will be considered a null value. 

FORCE_QUOTE - Optional. Specifies the columns that has to be enclosed inside 
          quote for CSV mode.

QUOTE - Required when FORMAT is CSV. Specifies the quotation character for 
        CSV mode. The default is double-quote ("). 

HEADER - Optional. Specifies that a header row (contains the names of the columns)
         has to be added as the first line in the target file(s).
         If using multiple data target files, each file will have a header row.
         The default is that the output files do not have a header row. 

ENCODING - Optional. Character set encoding of the source data. Specify 
           a string constant (such as 'SQL_ASCII'), an integer encoding 
           number, or 'DEFAULT' to use the default client encoding. If 
           not specified, the default client encoding is used. For 
           information about supported character sets, see the 
           "Greenplum Database Reference Guide."

EXTERNAL - Optional. Defines the schema of the external table database 
           objects created by gpunload. The default is to use the Greenplum 
           Database search_path. 

SCHEMA - Required when EXTERNAL is declared. The name of the schema of 
         the external table. If the schema does not exist, an error is returned. 

         If % (percent character) is specified, the schema of the table name 
         specified by TABLE in the INPUT section is used. If the table name 
         does not specify a schema, the default schema is used.

INPUT - Required. Defines the source table that is to be unloaded from
        the database. 

TABLE - Required. The name of the source table to unload from. 

EXTRACT_CONDITION - Optional. Filter the data to extract: it adds 
       a WHERE clause to the SELECT query.
   
MAPPING - Optional. If a mapping is specified, it overrides the default 
       source-to-target column mapping. The default source-to-target 
       mapping is based on a match of column names as defined in the 
       target COLUMNS section and the column names of the source TABLE.
       A mapping is specified as either:
            <target_column_name>: <source_column_name>
       or
            <target_column_name>: '<expression>'
            
       Where expression is any expression that you would specify in the 
       SELECT list of a query, such as a constant value, a column reference,
       an operator invocation, a function call, and so on.

OPTIONS - Optional. Specifies operations to run prior to the unload operation. 

APPEND - Optional. If set to true, gpunload will add the new extracted rows at 
       the end of the existing file. If the file doesn't already exist, the file
       is created. If HEADER = true, the header is added only if the target file
       doesn't already exist

       If set to false, a new target file is created, even if it already exists.
       If not set, the behavior is like APPEND=False

REUSE_TABLES - Optional. If set to true, gpunload will not drop the external table 
       objects it creates. These objects will be reused for future unload
       operations that use the same unload specifications. This improves 
       performance of trickle unloads (ongoing small unloads from the same
       source table).

SQL - Optional. Defines SQL commands to run before and/or after the load 
       operation. You can specify multiple BEFORE and/or AFTER commands. List 
       commands in the order of desired execution.

BEFORE - Optional. An SQL command to run before the load operation starts. 
       Enclose commands in quotes.

AFTER - Optional. An SQL command to run after the load operation completes. 
       Enclose commands in quotes.

***********************************************************
CONTROL FILE SCHEMA ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS (WINDOWS SPECIFIC)
***********************************************************

WINDOWS_DISK - Optional. 
        By default, the output files will be placed into the C disk.
        If the output files must be stored on a different disk, use this option to specify the windows disk.
        For example: windows_disk: Z

*****************************************************
NOTES
*****************************************************
If your database object names were created using a double-quoted 
identifier (delimited identifier), you must specify the delimited name 
within single quotes in the gpunload control file. For example, if you 
create a table as follows: 

     CREATE TABLE "MyTable" ("MyColumn" text);

Your YAML-formatted gpunload control file would refer to the above 
table and column names as follows:

        - COLUMNS:
          - '"MyColumn"': text
    
    INPUT:
        - TABLE: public.'"MyTable"'



*****************************************************
LOG FILE FORMAT
*****************************************************

Log files output by gpunload have the following format:

<timestamp>|<level>|<message>

Where <timestamp> takes the form: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, 
<level> is one of DEBUG, LOG, INFO, ERROR, 
and <message> is a normal text message.

Some INFO messages that may be of interest 
in the log files are (where # corresponds 
to the actual number of seconds, units of data, 
or failed rows):

INFO|running time: #.## seconds
INFO|transferred #.# kB of #.# kB.
INFO|gpunload succeeded
INFO|gpunload failed


*****************************************************
EXAMPLES
*****************************************************

Run an extract job as defined in my_unload.yml:

  gpunload -f my_unload.yml
